    <h1 id="javaProjectH1">Java Dashboard Project</h1>
    <section class="javaProjectInfo">
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>In my Application Development class, we created a dashboard application using Java that would keep track of
            product inventory, customers' information, order information, and allow employees to make changes to that
            information as needed. We worked as a group of 3 to create the application and then proceeded to switch
            projects with another group to fix anything that was not previously functioning correctly, update some
            design elements, and create new JUnit tests.</p>
        <h2> Homepage</h2>

        <p> On the homepage of the dashboard, we found it very important that the user is able to find all the
            information they may need on one page. If they need to find information about a customer, they can search
            the name or the order ID using the Quick Search option. Based on that search result, they will see the
            orders that are associated with the name or order ID, along with any filled or unfilled orders that they
            have.</p>

            <figcaption>Dashboard Home</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h2>Customer Page</h2>


        <p>On the Customer Page, the user can search for a specific name and can find their information, as well as edit
            and save that information within that same tab. There is also the option to create a new customer, which
            leads the user to a tab where they can fill out the new customer's information and save their information.
        </p>

            <figcaption>Dashboard Customer</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h2>Order Page</h2>

        <p>On the order page, there is an option to search for specific orders to find information about those orders,
            such as the order ID, the customer ID associated with that ID, the date ordered, date filled, as well as
            information about each order. On this page, the user can also place an order and get the order filled as
            well.</p>
        <figure>

            <figcaption>Dashboard Order</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>If the user clicks on "create new order", then they are led to a page where they can create an order for a
            previously existing customer, or they have the option to create a new customer and put their information
            into the system.</p>

        <h2>What We Learned</h2>
        <p>Throughout the semester, we used Eclipse, an integrated development environment (IDE) to write our Java
            code,
            create graphical user interfaces (GUI's), and to conduct JUnit testing. We also learned how to
            collaborate
            as a team using GitHub to create repositories and create and commit to branches. </p>
        <h2>Challenges We Faced</h2>
        <p>There were a lot of challenges we faced during the design and development processes. During the design
            process, we realized very quickly that having an interface that was easy to navigate and understand would
            allow the user have a better experience. Once we realized how important logic flow is for usability, we
            could make necessary change to the dashboard.</p>
        <p>During the development process, we struggled with making sure that all orders were associated with a customer
            and making sure that customers showed up on the customer dashboard even when they haven't placed an order
            yet. Learning GitHub was also a learning curve for us.</p>
